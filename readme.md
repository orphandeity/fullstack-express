## Getting Started

### Development Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project-directory`
3. Install dependencies for both the client and server by running:
   ```sh
   npm run setup
   ```
4. Start the development server using:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command concurrently starts the development servers for both the client and server.

### Production Setup

For a production setup, use the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your production environment.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project-directory`
3. Install dependencies and build the client and server by running:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command installs dependencies and builds both the client and server for production.

4. Start the production server using:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a friendly message from the server.
