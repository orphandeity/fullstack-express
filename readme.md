## Getting Started

### Development Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project-directory`.
3. Install dependencies for both the client and server by running:
   ```sh
   npm run setup
   ```
4. Start the development server using:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command concurrently starts the development servers for both the client and server.

### Production Setup

For a production setup, use the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your production environment.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project-directory`.
3. Install dependencies and build the client and server by running:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command installs dependencies and builds both the client and server for production.

4. Start the production server using:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Database Configuration

This template utilizes Knex for database connectivity. To configure your database connection, follow these steps:

### Development Environment:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`.

2. Open the `.env` file and add your database connection details, such as host, database name, user, and password.

### Production Environment:

In a production environment, you should use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for your database connection. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable should contain the connection details for your production database.

## Authentication

The project features local authentication with Passport. To set up your authentication, you'll need to:

1. Configure Passport and authentication strategies in the `server` directory.

2. Add your custom authentication logic and routes as needed.

## Usage

This template provides a solid foundation for your web development projects. Customize and extend it to meet your specific requirements. It's designed to save you time and effort by providing essential boilerplate code for web application development.
